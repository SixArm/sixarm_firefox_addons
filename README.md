# Firefox Â» Add-ons

This repo tracks the Firefox add-ons that we use and like.

Each add-on has a text file with:

  * name
  * link
  * summary
  * note, e.g. if we have donated

## Blocking

For blocking, we recommend "uBlock Origin" as the top choice over all these:

  * uBlock Origin, a.k.a. U Block For Origin - best choice IMHO.
  * uBlock (not Origin) - disruptions with the developer who took over uBlock.
  * U Block For Origin - a browser app, not an extension.
  * Adblock - sold to unknown company.
  * Adblock Plus (ABP) - good, but seems to use a lot of memory on our systems.
  * AdBlock - removed from the Firefox extensions due to name confusing.
